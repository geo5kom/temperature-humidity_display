# Arduino Temperature/Humidity Sensor

##Introduction
This is a simple Arduino project that makes use of the DHT11 (or DHT22) temperature/humidity sensor as well as a I2C LCD display. A standard LCD display could also be used by including a seperate library.

The project allows you to switch between viewing the current temperature and the current humidity on the LCD display. Other functions such as a heat index calculation and hourly averages can be added easily.

##Connections
Using an Arduino Uno connect the DHT11, buttons and LCD dispaly as follows.

After connecting your Arduino as shown in the schematic above and uploading the src.ino sketch to your Arduino Uno your temperature/humitity sensor should be up and running.

If you are feeling extra creative you could wrap your project up into a box and power it with a 9V battery.
